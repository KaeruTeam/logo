# Kaeru Team Logo

Logo assets for Kaeru Team, provided for use when referencing us and our work.

### Guidelines

* `kaeru_outline` should be used in most cases. PNG renders from 2048x2048 down to 32x32 are provided, as well as SVG, so please choose the one that matches your target resolution.

* If the logo might be displayed at resolutions below ~ 80x80, We'd prefer that you use `kaeru_fill` for better readability. `kaeru_fill` PNG renders are provided from 2048x2048 down to 16x16, as well as SVG.

* Always scale the logo down. For example, if you want to show the logo at 320x320, it's better to take the 512x512 PNG render and scale it down rather than using the 256x256 one and scaling it up.

* `kaeru_outline` or `kaeru_fill` should generally be favored over `kaeru_outline_transparent` or `kaeru_fill_transparent`. These variants are only provided for special circumstances such as overlays or printing.

* Please **don't** modify these logos or use them to brand third-party projects without express permission from Kaeru Team. The use of these logos in third-party merchandise is also not permitted.

* When using the names of Kaeru Team, its services or staff in news reporting or fan creations, please ensure you do so in a manner that does not imply that we endorse your work or activities unless instructed otherwise. For example, "Acme for Kaeru Gallery" would be fine but "Kaeru Gallery Acme" or "Kaeru Acme" would not, as that would suggest to a casual observer that we are involved.
